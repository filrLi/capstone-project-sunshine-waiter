    - Design a draft version for the main functions of this application
        - Data stuctures of object/entities, see 'Terminology.md'
        - UI, API on major functions of all roles including customer, kitchen, waiter, manager.
        - A temporary task assigning to every individual for the functions mentioned above.
        > A whole-journey-contribution credit to YaoyeLu of pair-designing on almost everypart of this task
        > Contribution credit to ZitongLi for implementation of 'long connection' (He found `WebSocket` as solution and will workout a demo to help everyone understanding it.)

    - Setup pages (react components) and coresponding navigation 
        > so that everyone can start play around on their own page without messing up other's git record.
